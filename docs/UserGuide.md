Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a **desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TA) to track student progress and tasks,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAA can get your students and tasks management done
faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words surrounded in angled brackets (`< >`), e.g. `<taskName>`, are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `tutorial add g/<tutorialGroup>`, `<tutorialGroup>` is a parameter which can be used as `tutorial add g/T03`.

* Optional parameters are indicated with `(optional)`.<br>
  e.g. `task add tn/<taskName> i/<taskDescription> d/<taskDeadline> s/<student(s)>(optional)`
  can be used as
  * `task add tn/Assignment 6 i/Recursion d/31/12/2023` or
  * `task add tn/Assignment 6 i/Recursion d/31/12/2021 s/Thomas Edison` or
  * `task add tn/Assignment 6 i/Recursion d/31/12/2021 s/Thomas Edison s/George Washington`.

* Arguments with `(s)` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. See the above example regarding `s/<student(s)>`.

* Parameters can be specified in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `group expel g/<groupName> s/<studentName>`, both of the following commands are equivalent:
  * `group expel g/T03 s/Billy Boy`
  * `group expel s/Billy Boy g/T03`

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/80000000 p/88888888`, only `p/88888888` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help me`, `bye bye`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if you enter `help me pretty p/lease`, it will be interpreted as `help me`.
